## Installing the Stepsize Layer plugin for JetBrains IDEs

The plugin works with all JetBrains IDEs – IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, PhpStorm, etc. as well as AndroidStudio.

- Download the Stepsize Layer plugin zip file [here](https://github.com/Stepsize/plugins/archive/master.zip)
- Find it in your downloads directory and double click to unzip it – it will create a directory called `plugins-master`
- From your JetBrains IDE, open the Preferences pane
- Click on `Plugins` in the left side panel
- Click `Install plugin from disk...`
- Find the `plugins-master` directory you just downloaded, and select the `stepsize_intellij.jar` file inside the `IntelliJStepsize` directory and click `OK`
- Click the `Restart IDE` button and you're good to go!
