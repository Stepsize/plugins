- Click on `Plugins` in the left side panel
- Click `Install plugin from disk...`
- Find the `plugins-master` directory you just downloaded, and select the `stepsize_intellij.jar` file inside the `IntelliJStepsize` directory and click `OK`
- Click the `Restart IDE` button and you're good to go!

## Uninstalling the Stepsize Layer plugin for JetBrains IDEs

Simply remove the `stepsize_intellij.jar` file from the support directory for your JetBrains IDE, usually located at `~/Library/Application Support/<IDE name + version>` by default.
